cover:

- data manipulation with `dplyr`: `select()` + `:` + `matches()`, `rename()`, `mutate()`
- pipes `%>%`
- cleaning up things: `stringr`, `na_if()`
- factors to improve visualisation: `fct_reorder()` for example?
- more missing data
  - `drop_na()`: how to remove missing data (and when should we do it?)
  - visualise missing data (special `naniar` geometries?) - data not missing at random!
