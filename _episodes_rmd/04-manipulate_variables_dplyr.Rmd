In this lesson we're going to learn how to use the `dplyr` package to manipulate columns 
of our data. 

As usual when starting an analysis on a new script, let's start by loading the 
packages and reading the data. In this lesson we're going to start using the 
[full dataset](https://github.com/tavareshugo/r-eda-gapminder/raw/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder1960to2010_socioeconomic.csv) 
with data from 1960 to 2010:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Read the data, specifying how missing values are encoded
gapminder1960to2010 <- read_csv("data/gapminder1960to2010_socioeconomic.csv", 
                                na = "")
```


## Selecting columns

In an [earlier episode]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/02-data_frames.md %}) we've seen how to select columns (and rows) of a data frame 
using the square-bracket operator `[rows, columns]`. 
With the `dplyr` package, there is an alternative function, which offers some flexibility 
in how we choose columns. 

Let's start with a simple example of selecting two columns from our table:

```{r}
select(gapminder1960to2010, country, year)
```

Using the _base R_ syntax, this is equivalent to `gapminder1960to2010[, c("country", "year")]`. 
Notice that with the `select()` function (and generally with `dplyr` functions) we 
didn't need to quote `"` the column names. This is because the first input to the 
function is the table name, and so everything after is assumed to be column names 
of that table. 

Where `select()` becomes very convenient is when combined with some other helper functions.
For example:

```{r}
# Select columns which have the word "_male" in their name
select(gapminder1960to2010, matches("_male"))

# Select all columns between country and year
select(gapminder1960to2010, country:year)
```

And these can be combined with each other:

```{r}
select(gapminder1960to2010, country, matches("_male"), matches("_men"))
```

To see other helper functions to use with `select()` check the following help page 
`?select_helpers`.

Finally, it can sometimes be helpful to _unselect_ some columns. We can do this 
by appending `-` before the column names we want to exclude, for example try running:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
select(gapminder1960to2010, -country, -income_groups)
```


> ## `dplyr` syntax
> 
> All `dplyr` functions follow the following convention:
> 
> - The _first input_ to the function is always a `data.frame`/`tibble`.
> - Next come other inputs specific to the function. Column names usually don't need 
>   to be quoted `"`.
> - The _output_ is always a `data.frame`/`tibble`.

## Renaming columns 

Use the `rename()` function to change column names, with the following syntax:
`rename(my_table, new_column_name = old_column_name)`. For example:

```{r}
rename(gapminder1960to2010, 
       country_code = country_id, continent = world_region)
```


## Creating or modifying columns

To create new columns or modify existing ones, we can use the `mutate()` function. 
Here is an example where we calculate the total population for each country:

```{r}
mutate(gapminder1960to2010, 
       population_total = population_male + population_female)
```

The new column is attached to the end of the table. We can't see its values printed here, 
because there are too many columns, but we can see that it is listed at the bottom of 
the printed result.  

Notice that the `gapminder1960to2010` object did not change, because we didn't assign 
(`<-`) the output of `mutate()` to it. To update our table, then we need to do:

```{r}
gapminder1960to2010 <- mutate(gapminder1960to2010, 
                              population_total = population_male + population_female)
```

Now, we can check its values by using `select()`, as we've learned above:

```{r}
select(gapminder1960to2010, 
       country, population_male, population_female, population_total)
```


## Chaining commands with the `%>%` _pipe_

In the examples above, we saw how to perform each of these operations individually. 
But what if we wanted to mutate, then select some columns and then rename some of those? 

This type of operation, where we want to _chain_ several commands after each other, 
can be done with *pipes*. In `tidyverse` pipes look like `%>%`. 

Let's see an example in action:

```{r}
gapminder1960to2010 %>% 
  mutate(., population_total = population_male + population_female) %>% 
  select(., country, world_region, population_total) %>% 
  rename(., continent = world_region)
```

Let's break this down:

- We start with the data, `gapminder1960to2010` and "pipe" it (`%>%`) to the next function, 
  `mutate()`.
- In `mutate()` we used the `.` symbol to indicate the input is coming from the previous pipe. 
  And the output will be again "piped" to the next function, `select()`.
- In `select()` we again used the `.` symbol to indicate the input is coming the from previous pipe 
  (i.e. the table with a new column, `population_total` added to it). And again, we send this to...
- `rename()`, which again receives it's input from the pipe. And our chain of commands ends here. 

You can interpret the `%>%` as meaning "and then", and so we can _read_ the code above as:

> Take the `gapminder1960to2010` table _and then_ add a new column with total population 
> _and then_ select only some of the columns _and then_ rename one of the columns.

The purpose of the pipes is to make the order of the data manipulation steps clear, 
and we will be using them throughout the course. However, they are not mandatory, 
and the same operations could have been done without them. For example, by saving 
the output of each step in a temporary object, which would then be used as input to 
the next function. Here are the same steps as above using this strategy:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# First mutate the column of interest
gapminder1960to2010_modified <- mutate(gapminder1960to2010,
                                       population_total = population_male + population_female)

# Then select columns of interest from this modified table
gapminder1960to2010_modified <- select(gapminder1960to2010_modified, 
                                       country, world_region, population_total)

# Finally rename the modified table
rename(gapminder1960to2010_modified, continent = world_region)
```

One clear disadvantage of this approach is that we now have an object `gapminder1960to2010_modified` 
loaded in our _Environment_ (top-right panel of RStudio), which we may actually only 
be interested in temporarily.

## Manipulating categorical data

In this section we're going to use `mutate()` to change some of the categorical 
(character) variables in our dataset. 

The `stringr` package provides several functions to manipulate _strings_ (i.e. character values). 
The functions from that package start with the word `str_`, so they are easy to identify. 

Here is an example:

```{r}
gapminder1960to2010 %>% 
  # remove the word "_income" from the income_groups values; and then...
  mutate(world_region = str_remove(income_groups, "_income")) %>% 
  # replace the "_" with a hyphen
  mutate(income_groups = str_replace(income_groups, "_", "-"))
```

> ## Exercise
> 
> Create a new table called `gapminder_clean`, which fulfils the following requirements:
> 
> - Fix any typos in the `main_religion` values. All values should be in Title Case.
> - The `world_region` column contains values with a space between words (not "_") and in Title Case.
> - The `income_groups` column contains the categories: "Low", "Lower Middle", "Upper Middle", "High".
> - The `life_expectancy` column should be numeric.
> - Include a column `population_total` with the total population of the country. This column should 
>   appear before the `population_male` column (the other columns should remain in the same order).
> 
> (hint: `str_to_title()`, `str_remove()`, `str_replace_all()`, `str_squish()`)
> 
> The final table should contain 9843 observations (rows) and 20 variables (columns), 
> 6 of them character and the rest numeric.

#### Using _factors_ to encode _ordinal_ categorical data

As we discussed in a [previous episode](({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/01-objects_functions_vectors.md %})), categorical data come in three flavours: 
nominal, ordinal and binary.

<a href="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/README.md">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/other-stats-artwork/nominal_ordinal_binary.png" width="500">
</a>

While `character` vectors can be used to encode non-ordered (nominal) categories, 
they are not suitable to encode ordered ones. For this, we need to use **factors**, which 
are a special type of vector that stores categorical data. 

Here is an example using a character vector:

```{r}
mood <- c("unhappy", "awesome", "ok", "awesome", "unhappy")

# convert mood character vector to a factor
factor(mood)
```

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, known as _levels_, 
which correspond to the unique values in the data.  By default, R always sorts levels 
in alphabetical order, like in the example above. 

Sometimes, the order of the levels does not matter, other times you might want
to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., "low", "medium", "high"),
it improves your visualization, or it is required by a particular type of
analysis. 

Here is how we would reorder the levels of the `mood` vector:

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
factor(mood, levels = c("unhappy", "ok", "awesome"))
```

The `forcats` package (part of `tidyverse`) provides several other functions to 
manipulate factors. These functions all start with `fct_`, so they are easy to 
identify. Look at the [package documentation](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/) to 
learn more about it.
