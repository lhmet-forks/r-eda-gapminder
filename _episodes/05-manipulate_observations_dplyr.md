- `filter()`
- how to obtain observations from our data based on certain criteria: `filter()`
  - intro to to logical operators
- Logical operators for missing data
- use of `ifelse` to correct some harder typos "manually"
  - `ifelse(main_religion == "cristian", "christian", main_religion)`
- highlighting observations in graphs with `ifelse()`?
- saving cleaned version of our data: `write_csv()`



If your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar with the
functions `is.na()`, `na.omit()`, and `complete.cases()`. See below for
examples.




~~~
## Extract those elements which are not missing values.
rooms[!is.na(rooms)]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'rooms' not found
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
## Returns the object with incomplete cases removed. The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or `"double"`).
na.omit(rooms)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in na.omit(rooms): object 'rooms' not found
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
## Extract those elements which are complete cases. The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or `"double"`).
rooms[complete.cases(rooms)]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'rooms' not found
~~~
{: .error}
