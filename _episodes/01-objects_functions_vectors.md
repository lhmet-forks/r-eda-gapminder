## Creating Objects in R

Often, you want to save the output of an operation for later use. 
In other words, we need to assign **values** to **objects**. 
To create an object, we need to give it a name followed by the
**assignment operator** `<-`, and the value we want to give to it.

For example: 


~~~
area_hectares <- 1
~~~
{: .language-r}

We can read the code as: the _value_ 1 is _assigned_ to the _object_ area_hectares. 
Note that when you run this line of code the object you just created appears on 
your _environment_ tab (top-right panel).

When assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything on the console. 
You can print the value by typing the object name on the console:


~~~
area_hectares
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1
~~~
{: .output}


> ## How should I name objects?
> 
> Object names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods. They
> _cannot start with a number nor contain spaces_. Different people use
> different conventions for long variable names, two common ones being:
> 
> - Underscore: `my_long_named_object`
> - Camel case: `myLongNamedObject`
> 
> What you use is up to you, but **be consistent**.
> 
> Also note that R is case-sensitive so `area_hectares` is different from `Area_hectares`.
{: .discussion}
<p></p>

Now that R has `area_hectares` in memory, we can do operations with it. 
For instance, we may want to convert this area into acres (area in acres is 2.47 
times the area in hectares):


~~~
2.47 * area_hectares
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 2.47
~~~
{: .output}

We can also change an object's value by assigning it a new one:


~~~
area_hectares <- 2.5
2.47 * area_hectares
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 6.175
~~~
{: .output}

Finally, assigning a value to one object does not change the values of other objects. 
For example, let's store the plot's area in acres in a new object, `area_acres`:


~~~
area_acres <- 2.47 * area_hectares
~~~
{: .language-r}

and then change `area_hectares` to 50.


~~~
area_hectares <- 50
~~~
{: .language-r}

Note that this did not change the value of `area_acres`.

## Functions and Their Arguments

Functions perform specific operations or tasks in R. A **function**
usually gets one or more inputs called **arguments** and returns a **value**. 
A typical example would be the function `sqrt()`. The input (the argument) must 
be a number, and the return value (the output) is the square root of that number. 
Executing a function ('running it') is refered to as *calling* the function. 
An example of a function call is:


~~~
b <- sqrt(a)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Here, the value of `a` is given to the `sqrt()` function, the `sqrt()` function
calculates the square root, and returns the value which is then assigned to
the object `b`. This function is very simple, because it takes just one argument.

The return value of a function need not be numerical (like that of `sqrt()`),
and it also does not need to be a single item: it can be a set of things, or
even a dataset. We'll see that when we read data files into R.

Arguments can be anything, not only numbers or filenames, but also other
objects. Exactly what each argument means differs per function, and must be
looked up in the documentation (detailed below). Some functions take arguments which
may either be specified by the user, or, if left out, take on a *default* value:
these are called *options*. Options are typically used to alter the way the
function operates. 

Let's try a function that can take multiple arguments: 


~~~
round(3.14159)  # round a number
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 3
~~~
{: .output}

Here, we've called `round()` with just one argument, `3.14159`, and it has
returned the value `3`.  That's because the default is to round to the nearest
whole number. If we want more digits we can see how to do that by getting
information about the `round` function.  We can look at the help of any function 
by typing `?` followed by the function's name. In this case:


~~~
?round
~~~
{: .language-r}

We see that if we want a different number of digits, we can type `digits = 2` or 
however many we want.


~~~
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 3.14
~~~
{: .output}

If you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you
don't have to name them:


~~~
round(3.14159, 2)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 3.14
~~~
{: .output}

And if you do name the arguments, you can switch their order:


~~~
round(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 3.14
~~~
{: .output}

It's good practice to put the non-optional arguments (like the number you're
rounding) first in your function call, and to specify the names of all optional
arguments.  If you don't, someone reading your code might have to look up the
definition of a function with unfamiliar arguments to understand what you're
doing.


## Vectors and Data Types

A vector is the most common and basic data structure in R. It consists of a collection 
of values that can be created with the `c()` function. For example:


~~~
some_numbers <- c(62, 77, 0, 6)
some_numbers
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 62 77  0  6
~~~
{: .output}

A vector can also contain _character_ values, for example:


~~~
some_animals <- c("cat", "dog", "giraffe", "dog")
some_animals
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "cat"     "dog"     "giraffe" "dog"    
~~~
{: .output}

The quotes `""` are essential here. Without the quotes R
will assume there are objects called `cat`, `dog` and `giraffe`. 
As these objects don't exist in R's memory, there would be an error message.

There are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a
vector. `length()` tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:


~~~
length(some_numbers)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 4
~~~
{: .output}

The function `class()` indicates what kind of object it is:


~~~
class(some_numbers)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "numeric"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class(some_animals)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "character"
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Data types in R
> 
> The main data types in R are:
> 
> - numeric or double (a number with decimal points)
> - integer (a number with no decimal points)
> - character
> - logical: `TRUE` or `FALSE` (we will discuss these in a future episode)
> 
{: .callout}
<p></p>

You can use the `c()` function to add other elements to your vector:


~~~
c(some_animals, "ant", "fruit fly")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "cat"       "dog"       "giraffe"   "dog"       "ant"       "fruit fly"
~~~
{: .output}

Or even combine vectors together:


~~~
c(some_animals, some_animals)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "cat"     "dog"     "giraffe" "dog"     "cat"     "dog"     "giraffe"
[8] "dog"    
~~~
{: .output}

> There are several shortcuts to create sequences of numbers, and these can be 
very useful in different situations:

> 10:1                           # integers from 10 to 1
> seq(1, 10, by = 2)             # from 1 to 10 by steps of 2
> seq(10, 1, by = -0.5)          # from 10 to 1 by steps of -0.5
> seq(1, 10, length.out = 20)    # 20 equally spaced values from 1 to 10
> ~~~
> {: .language-r}
{: .callout}


### Subsetting Vectors

If we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must provide one
or several indices in square brackets. For instance:


~~~
some_animals <- c("cat", "dog", "giraffe", "dog")

# the second element of the vector
some_animals[2]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "dog"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
# the third and second elements of the vector
some_animals[c(3, 2)]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "giraffe" "dog"    
~~~
{: .output}

We can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements than the
original one:


~~~
some_animals[c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3)]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "cat"     "dog"     "dog"     "giraffe" "giraffe"
~~~
{: .output}


## Vectorised operations

R deals with vector operations in a special way. Let's take the addition of two 
numeric vectors as an example.

When operating on two vectors of _the same length_, R takes the elements of each 
vector one by one:


~~~
c(10, 20, 30, 40) + c(1, 2, 3, 4)  # equivalent to c(10 + 1, 20 + 2, 30 + 3, 40 + 4)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 11 22 33 44
~~~
{: .output}

When operating on two vectors of _different lengths_, R will "recycle" the shortest 
vector (that is, it goes back to the start of the shortest vector when it runs out 
of values to pair with the longest vector):


~~~
c(10, 20, 30, 40) + c(1, 2)  # equivalent to c(10 + 1, 20 + 2, 30 + 1, 40 + 2)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 11 22 31 42
~~~
{: .output}

This means that if we add a single number to a numeric vector, then R adds it to 
every value of the vector (because it "recycles" that single value every time):


~~~
c(10, 20, 30, 40) + 1  # equivalent to c(10 + 1, 20 + 1, 30 + 1, 40 + 1)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 11 21 31 41
~~~
{: .output}


## Missing Data

As R was designed to analyze datasets, it includes the concept of missing data.
Missing data are represented as the value `NA` (with no quotes around it).


~~~
some_numbers <- c(2, 1, 1, NA, 4)
class(some_numbers)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "numeric"
~~~
{: .output}

Note that the presence of the missing value did not change the type of vector we 
have, in this case it's a numeric vector, despite having missing data.

Most functions in R will deal with `NA`, although in different ways. Some will 
simply not want any missing data and warn you about it. Others will drop the missing 
values (with or without a warning!). And yet others will optionally remove them 
for you if you want. 

We will talk more about missing values througout the lessons, for now it's just good 
to be aware that functions in R can deal with them.

### Value Coercion

An important thing to be aware of is that _all of the elements in a vector have
to be of the same type_. 
Use the following exercise to see what R does when a vector contains a mixed types of values.

> ## Exercise
>
> Use `class()` to check the data type of the following objects:
>
>  
>  ~~~
>  num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
>  num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
>  char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
>  tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
>  ~~~
>  {: .language-r}
> > ## Solution

> > class(char_logical) # is character
> > class(tricky)       # is character because 4 is quoted
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-r}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

You've probably noticed that vectors of different types get converted into a single, 
shared type within a vector. In R, we call converting values from one type into 
another _coercion_. These conversions happen according to a hierarchy,
where some types get preferentially coerced into other types. The hierarchy is:
`character > numeric > integer > logical`.

There are functions that we can use to do explicit coercion between types, such 
as `as.numeric()` and `as.character()`. 


~~~
num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")   # this is a character vector
as.numeric(num_char)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Warning: NAs introduced by coercion
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
[1]  1  2  3 NA
~~~
{: .output}

In this example, the `as.numeric()` function converted all values that looked like 
numbers, whereas the value "a" was converted to a missing value. The
function also prints a warning, which is useful for us to be aware that 
some values were impossible to convert to a number. 

The importance of value coercion will become apparent in the next lesson, 
when we import data from a file.
