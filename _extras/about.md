## Acknowledgements

These materials are being developed by [Hugo Tavares](https://github.com/tavareshugo), 
with the financial support from the 
[GSLS Biostatistics Initiative](https://www.biostats.lifesci.cam.ac.uk/) 
at Cambridge University. 

Some of the materials are re-used and inspired from other Data Carpentry lessons, 
so these materials were made possible only due to the amazing community of trainers 
and lesson maintainers.
