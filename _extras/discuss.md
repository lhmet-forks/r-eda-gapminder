**Reference books:**

- Holmes S, Huber W, [Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/) - covers many aspects of data analysis relevant for biology/bioinformatics from statistical modelling to image analysis.
- Peng R, [Exploratory Data Analysis with R](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/) - a general introduction to exploratory data analysis techniques.
- Grolemund G & Wickham H, [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - a good follow up from this course if you want to learn more about `tidyverse` packages.
- McElreath R, [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) - an introduction to statistical modelling and inference using R (a more advanced topic, but written in an accessible way to non-statisticians).
    - Also see the [lecture materials](https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019), which include access to the draft of the book's second edition. 
-  James G, Witten D, Hastie T & Tibshirani R, [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) - an introductory book about machine learning using R (also advanced topic).
    - Also see [this course material](https://lgatto.github.io/IntroMachineLearningWithR/) for a practical introduction to this topic.


## Data analysis tips

> ## Starting your project
> 
> - Create a directory for your project
> - Create a few sub-directories such as `scripts` and `data`
> - Create a new "R Project" <kbd>File</kbd> > <kbd>New Project...</kbd>

> ## Quality control checks
> 
> Whenever you read data into R, it's always good practice to do some quality 
> checks. Here's a list of things to lookout for:
> 
> - Do you have the expected number of rows and columns?
> - Are your variables (columns) of the expected type? (e.g. numeric, character)
> - Is the range of numeric data within expected boundaries? For example: a column with 
>   months should range from 1 to 12; a column with someone's age should not 
>   contain negative values; etc...
> - Do you have the expected number of unique values in categorical (character) variables?
> - Do you have missing values in the data, and were these imported correctly?
> 
> In R, you can answer many of these questions with the help of the following 
> functions: `str()`, `summary()`, `length()` + `unique()`, `nrow()`, `ncol()`, 
> `is.na()`.
> 
> There are also some R packages that can help making these diagnostic analysis 
> easier. One good one is the `skimr` package (which has a good 
> [`introduction document`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/skimr/vignettes/Using_skimr.html). > If you use the `skim()` function with your `data.frame` it will give you a tabular 
> summary that will help you answer all these questions in one go!
